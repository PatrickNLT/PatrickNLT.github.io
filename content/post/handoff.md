During my last week working at [Applidium](https://applidium.com), I wrote a blog post to highlight a little-known feature introduced by iOS 8: Handoff. With Handoff, you can start work on one device, then switch to another nearby device and pick up where you left off. As an app developer, it is a very handy feature that helps to create a consistent cross-platform experience for your users.

You can find more details about Handoff in my [article](https://en.fabernovel.com/insights/tech-en/handoff-the-bridge-between-your-app-and-your-website) and on Apple's [website](http://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/).
