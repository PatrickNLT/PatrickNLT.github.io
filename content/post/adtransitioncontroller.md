[Romain Goyet](https://twitter.com/lck), [Pierre Felgines](https://twitter.com/PierreFelgines) and I wrote [`ADTransitionController`](https://github.com/applidium/ADTransitionController), a handy library that lets you easily add custom 3D transitions to any app. You can use it either with the transition APIs introduced by iOS 7 or as a full replacement for UINavigationController.
